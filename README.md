# Group Representation of Global Intrinsic Symmetries


## Code
- These codes are the core parts of the algorithms in the paper.
- The codes have been tested on `Win7 x64 + Matlab 2012a (32 bit)`.
- The provided codes are just for academic use.


## Utilization
- Run "demo_C2Shape.m" to compute and visualize the global refelectional intrinsic symmetry on a horse model. <br>
- Run "demo_moreSymmetriesShape.m" to compute and visualize all of the global intrinsic symmetries on a table model.
